        <p>Our two installers, Jamison and Rob were the best! They arrived on time, left the areas clean, answered all questions and completed the job within the timeframe they gave us. This experience we definitely would cause us to consider Sears again. <br>

        <p>I recently had Sears reface my kitchen cabinets and now my kitchen looks like itâ€™s out of a magazine. People who had seen my kitchen before the re-facing say they cannot believe how gorgeous and how much better it now looks.<br>
